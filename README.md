# 360Imaging

Notes:
- I use faker library to generate random data
- You will find all Test cases in TCs.js
- I separate the navigaton to signup page in a separate JS file in Pages folder(navigation.js)
- I separate the process of filling up the data in a separate JS file in Pages folder(filldata.js)
- The testcases will success and if you want to fail, change anything in the assetions
